Credits go to @anlumo for the rendering implementation and @sirno for updating the API to support libmpv version 2.0.

# libmpv2-rs

A libmpv abstraction written in rust that's easy to use and provides the ability to read next to all video and audio codecs.

# Dependencies

Rust version >= 1.30. Libmpv version 2.0 (mpv version 0.35.0) is the minimum required version.

For ease of building, you can use the `build_libmpv` feature that is used to link against. Especially useful to cross compile to windows. The `MPV_SOURCE` environment variable needs to be set to a directory containing the mpv source you want to build against. For windows targets this is expected to be already built, with a directory named `MPV_SOURCE/64` or `/32` containing [build artifacts](https://mpv.srsfckn.biz/) for 64-bit and 32-bit targets respectively. On unix this is expected to be a copy of the mpv-build repo.

# Examples

To run an example, execute `cargo run [--release] --example x -- test-data/jellyfish.mp4`, where x is any of:

- `events`: event enumeration
- `protocol`: implementation of custom `filereader://` protocol thatâ€¦ reads files
- `opengl`: openGL rendering onto SDL2 window
